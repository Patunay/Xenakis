# Xenakis <font size="3" >_by Carlos Mauro_ </font>

## Introduction:

Xenakis is a software that aims to provide music composers with an alternate way of notating music. This is done by merging the qualities of graphical and traditional notation.

By doing so, the composer gets perks of graphic music notation such as: increased compositional fluency, absolute representation of musical register, freedom in the writing as well as the the pitch accuracy of traditionally notated music.

Xenakis takes .png images as inputs and outputs a pre-formated string ready to be read by the .bachscroll object in MaxMSP.
