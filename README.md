# Xenakis <font size="3" >*by Carlos Mauro* </font>



## Introduction:
 Xenakis is a software that aims to provide music composers with an alternate way of notating music. This is done by merging graphical and traditional notation. 
 
 By doing so, the composer gets perks of graphic music notation such as: incressed compositional fluency, explicity of musical register, freedomness in the writing as well as the the pitch accuracy of traditionally notated music.
